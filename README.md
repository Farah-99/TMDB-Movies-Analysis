Project 1: Studying a DataSet - TMDB Movie Dataset

# Project Overview
## Introduction
This is the first project and part of the qualification for the Udacity Data Analytsis Nanodegree. Its goal is to showcase how you can deal with your data in  order to deliever good conclusions. We were provided of a file containing many datsets and I chose the TMDB Movie dataset, not because I am fan of movies, mainly because when studying a dataset, domain expertise is required. I preprocessed my data, clean it and came out with many conclusions thanks to different vizualization tools.

## About the data

The TMDB Movie Database is a very popular online collaborative database for movie and television information. Around 10,000 movies' worth of data are included in it. The main objective of this project is to conduct in-depth analysis and visualization in order to generate answers to the raised queries.

## Preprocessing Data

A very important stage when dealing with data, we should have a globale overview of our data in order to know how to work on it.
Many pandas and numpy functions can help us with that. 

## Cleaning Data

We need to make sure that our data is clean (at least the columns we are interested in). This step can be super easy or super hard but I enjoyed it.


## Vizualization and Conclusions

Dealing with movie datasets means that the target is not just companies but also the audience, who often ask questions and seek multiple information about movies, cast, ...

I asked useful questions throughout my data analysis and have come to the following conclusions:

1-Drama is a popular genre when it comes to movie creation, so if you're an audience member and you enjoy this subgenre, you're in luck. Additionally, if your business is a production one, watch out for rivals. On the other hand, at the bottom we found the western genre. The reason behind that is that its viewership is decreasing. Similarly, the war and history genres suffer because of the high cost of production.

2-Robert De Niro is a big star, no doubt, and its existence with the ones in the top6 list will influence your revenue.

3-A number of elements, such as the budget, the runtime, and the audience, can influence the revenue.

4- In general, the best period to release a movie is summer, although the maximum was in winter, so as a production company, the safest choice is summer.

5-Budget has an impact on revenue; the more you invest, the more you earn; however, you may get lucky and win a lot with a small budget.

When it comes to limitations, this data contains so many categorical data which are combined, so the deal is a little bit harder. In addition, there is a lot of missing data.
