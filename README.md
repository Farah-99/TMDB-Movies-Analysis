Project 1: Studying a DataSet - TMDB Movie Dataset

# Project Overview
## Introduction
This is the first project and part of the qualification for the Udacity Data Analytsis Nanodegree. Its goal is to showcase how you can deal with your data in  order to deliever good conclusions. We were provided of a file containing many datsets and I chose the TMDB Movie dataset, not because I am fan of movies, mainly because when studying a dataset, domain expertise is required. I preprocessed my data, clean it and came out with many conclusions thanks to different vizualization tools.
